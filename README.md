This started out as a practice directory for studying Pandas for my Data Science class 
at Houston Community College, but then turned into learning how to bring Machine Learning 
to a sports situation. 

	1. Pitch Prediction Model
	•	Build a model that predicts the next pitch type (fastball, curveball, etc.) based on historical data for a particular pitcher and batter. You can incorporate pitch location, speed, count, and previous pitch type.
	2. Player Performance Analysis
	•	Create an app to predict a player’s future performance metrics, such as batting average or on-base percentage, based on their previous season’s stats and factors like age, position, and injury history.
	3. Injury Prediction and Prevention
	•	Use player movement data (e.g., biomechanics or gameplay stats) to identify early indicators of potential injuries. An app could alert coaching staff if players are at a higher risk based on specific metrics.
	4. Real-time Game Strategy Tool
	•	Design a tool that offers in-game recommendations for strategy based on a team’s current situation and the opposing team’s tendencies. This could include batting order changes, pinch-hitter suggestions, or defensive shifts.
	5. Fan Experience Enhancement
	•	Build a chatbot that answers baseball trivia, game stats, or provides player comparisons. Integrating natural language processing (NLP) can make it conversational and engaging.
	6. Player Comparison Tool
	•	An app that uses clustering or similarity scoring to compare players across eras or playing styles. You could incorporate various performance metrics and allow fans to see “similar players” to their favorites.
	7. Stadium Experience Optimization
	•	Analyze fan movement data within a stadium to identify crowding patterns and optimize concession and restroom locations, or offer personalized promotions based on game engagement and purchase behavior.
